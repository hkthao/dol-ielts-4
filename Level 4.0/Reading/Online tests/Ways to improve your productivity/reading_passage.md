Incredibly Easy Ways To Improve Your Productivity
“It’s not the number of hours you put into work; it is the amount of work (which) you put in those hours.” For people wanting to find a way to maximize productivity, these beneficial tips will be useful:
Take regular breaks
You might think it's a waste of time, but this is not true. Taking short breaks between work actually boosts concentration, creativity, and memory. People working continuously for long stretches of time often experience stress and exhaustion. Therefore, you should maximize your efficiency at work by taking frequent breaks to refresh and refuel your mind.

Eat the frog
Mark Twain once said, "Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day." Brian Tracy's famous 'eat the frog' technique is based on this quote. The 'frog' here is the most important task on your to-do list. People aiming to reach high levels of performance and productivity, Tracy says, should develop the lifelong habit of completing their major tasks first thing in the morning. But what do you do if you have more than one important task on your plate? "Eat the ugliest frog first", suggests the author. If you have more than one important task, the task considered to be most challenging should be done first.

Learn to single-task.
The human brain is not designed to multitask. In fact, according to research, multitasking reduces productivity by as much as 40%. This is because toggling between multiple tasks limits your focus, hampers working memory and increases stress and fatigue. In one study, people asked to switch between tasks show lower productivity than people asked to do one task at a time. So boost your productivity by focusing on only one task at a time.

Take advantage of your commute.
Instead of spending your time on social media during your morning bus or train ride, use those hours to gain more knowledge. Read thought-provoking books and articles or listen to a good podcast. Or, use that time to plan important tasks and respond to emails sent to you during the previous day.

Get organized.
Science says that people having a messy workspace are less efficient and more frustrated than those who have an organized work desk. A messy workspace limits your brain's ability to concentrate. This, in turn, contributes to stress and fatigue. So, improve your mental health and work efficiency by organizing your workspace. Start by getting rid of all the non-essential items taking up your working space. The best way to keep things organized without feeling overwhelmed or exhausted is to clean up your work desk every day before you go home.

Make a not-to-do list.
While there are benefits to creating a to-do list, a not-to-do list is also a productivity-boosting tool. The idea suggested here is to create a list of all of those bad habits that you want to stop doing in order to become more productive. You should take some time to think about any task affecting your productivity. Now prepare a not-to-do list to start moving away from these bad habits!
